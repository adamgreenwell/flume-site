## Build matrix

| Target                     | Runner                  | Output                |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| macOS 12+                  | `macos-latest`          | `.dmg`, `.app`        |
| Windows 10/11              | `windows-latest`        | `.msi`, `.exe` (NSIS) |
| Debian 12+ / Ubuntu 22.04+ | `ubuntu-22.04`          | `.deb`                |
| Fedora 38+ / RHEL 9.4+     | Fedora/RHEL 9 container | `.rpm`                |

**The Linux glibc floor is set by the build runner, not by our code.** A binary
built on Ubuntu 24.04 will not run on Debian 12. This is why CI pins
`ubuntu-22.04` for `.deb` and uses a RHEL 9-era container for `.rpm`.

Flume's TLS choice helps here: because we build librqbit with `rust-tls`
instead of native TLS, packages carry **no `libssl` runtime dependency**, which
removes the most common cross-distro breakage.

## macOS

**Minimum:** 12.0 (set in `tauri.conf.json`).

**WebView:** WKWebView, bundled with the OS. No runtime to ship.

**Unsigned builds** are blocked by Gatekeeper. Users can bypass via
right-click → Open, or:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Flume.app
```

**Signing** requires an Apple Developer account ($99/yr), a Developer ID
Application certificate, and notarization through Apple's service. Tracked in
[#18](https://github.com/adamgreenwell/flume/issues/18).

### Do not set `licenseFile` in `tauri.conf.json`

It looks like obvious good practice — ship the licence with the app — and what
it actually does on macOS is turn the `.dmg` into a **click-through EULA**.
Every user must accept an agreement before the disk image will open, and
non-interactive tooling cannot mount it at all (`hdiutil: attach canceled`).

That pattern is inherited from commercial software. Apache-2.0 is permissive
and applies whether or not anyone clicks Agree; the licence is already in the
repository, in `NOTICE`, and inside the app bundle. The gate adds friction and
buys nothing.

Confirm with:

```bash
hdiutil imageinfo Flume_x.y.z_aarch64.dmg | grep "Software License Agreement"
```

`false` is correct.

### Do not set `minimumSystemVersion` in `tauri.conf.json`

It looks like the obvious place to declare the minimum macOS, and it breaks the
release build.

Setting it makes the Tauri CLI export `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` for the entire
cargo invocation. That variable leaks into the **host** build of proc-macro
crates, where it breaks `ctor-proc-macro`; the build then fails with
`can't find crate for ctor_proc_macro`. Any value triggers it.

The minimum is declared in `src-tauri/Info.plist` instead, which
`tauri-bundler` merges into the generated plist. Finder enforces
`LSMinimumSystemVersion` either way, so the user-visible behaviour is the same.

See [#22](https://github.com/adamgreenwell/flume/issues/22) for the full
investigation.

**Universal binaries** (`--target universal-apple-darwin`) roughly double
bundle size. Decision deferred.

## Windows

**Minimum:** Windows 10 1803.

**WebView:** WebView2, preinstalled on Windows 11 and current Windows 10. Tauri
can bundle a bootstrapper for older systems.

**SmartScreen** warns on unsigned executables until a download reputation
builds. Code signing certificates cost real money annually; EV certificates
clear SmartScreen immediately, OV ones build reputation over time.

**Known issue — file locking and seeding.** Windows lets a process hold an
exclusive handle to a file, which can block seeding while another application
has the file open. A community client ("Drift") patched librqbit's storage
layer for this.

**Unverified on librqbit v9.** Tracked in
[#9](https://github.com/adamgreenwell/flume/issues/9). Confirm reproduction
before patching or vendoring.

## Linux

**WebView:** WebKitGTK 4.1. This is the single biggest source of rendering
differences from macOS and Windows — it lags on newer CSS features. Test layout
changes on Linux early rather than late.

### Debian / Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libappindicator3-dev \
  librsvg2-dev patchelf build-essential curl wget file libxdo-dev libssl-dev
```

### Fedora / RHEL / Rocky / Alma

```bash
sudo dnf install -y webkit2gtk4.1-devel openssl-devel curl wget file \
  libappindicator-gtk3-devel librsvg2-devel gcc gcc-c++ make
```

RHEL 9 derivatives may need EPEL for `libappindicator-gtk3-devel`. Verify
`webkit2gtk4.1` availability on the exact base image before relying on it.

### Wayland

Tauri runs under Wayland via GTK. If rendering misbehaves, force X11:

```bash
GDK_BACKEND=x11 flume
```

### AppImage

Optional additional output. Bundles more dependencies, so it works across more
distros at the cost of size.

## Magnet link association

Flume registers itself as a handler for `magnet:` URIs. How that registration
happens differs by platform, which matters when testing:

| Platform | Registered by                                        | Works in `tauri dev`?              |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| macOS    | `CFBundleURLTypes` in the bundled app's `Info.plist` | **No** — needs an installed `.app` |
| Windows  | Registry entries written by the installer            | **No** — needs an installed build  |
| Linux    | `.desktop` MIME entry, or at runtime                 | Yes, via runtime registration      |

On macOS the app logs `runtime deep-link registration unavailable
(unsupported platform)` at debug level on every dev start. That is expected,
not a fault: macOS has no runtime registration API, so the association only
exists for an installed bundle.

**Consequence for testing:** clicking a magnet link in a browser cannot be
verified with `npm run tauri:dev` on macOS or Windows. Build a bundle
(`npm run tauri:build`) and launch that instead.

Verified on macOS against a real bundle: `CFBundleURLTypes` registers the
`magnet` scheme, and launching the app a second time with a magnet argument
hands it to the running instance and exits, rather than starting a second
engine.

> **If another client is installed**, it may already own the `magnet:` default.
> Both apps are registered; macOS picks one. Change the default in the other
> client's settings, or via a LaunchServices utility.

## System tray

The tray is optional by design. Some Linux desktops ship no system tray at all,
so a failure to create the icon is logged and ignored rather than being fatal —
the app is perfectly usable without one.

Left-clicking the icon reveals the window on Windows and Linux; macOS opens the
menu on any click, which is the platform convention and is handled by Tauri.

## Sandboxing and firewalls

Flume needs:

- **Outbound TCP** to peers and trackers
- **Outbound UDP** for DHT
- **Inbound TCP** on the listen port (42221) for incoming peers and seeding
- **Outbound UDP to the gateway** for UPnP port mapping, if enabled

macOS prompts for incoming connections on first launch. Linux firewalls
(`ufw`, `firewalld`) usually need an explicit rule for inbound.

## Per-platform smoke checklist

Run before tagging a release:

- [ ] Window opens and renders correctly
- [ ] Engine reaches **Ready** within ~10s
- [ ] Listen port binds; verify in status
- [ ] Add a magnet (a Linux ISO) and confirm metadata resolves
- [ ] Download completes and file integrity verifies
- [ ] Seeding works with another client connected
- [ ] Quit and relaunch; torrent resumes without full re-hash
- [ ] Open containing folder works
- [ ] Theme matches system setting
